# React Employee Tracker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It makes a call to a random user generator, displays the results as a table, and lets users filter the results by name or sort in alphabetical order.

## Usage

Click the button that says "Sort Alphabetically By Name" to sort the results alphabetically by first name. Use the search form to search the results for all names that include the string you are searching for. Delete the string to bring up all previous results. Refreshing the page will bring up a new set of results. Use this to, uh, come up with your book character names, I guess.

## Future Development
I figure out how to use React and actually let people put stuff in here instead of making these random calls.
